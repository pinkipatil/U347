  Dear All, I feel very much pleased to welcome you all to Hirasugar Institute of Technology (HIT) Nidasoshi.
   HIT, over the past years of its existence has carved a niche for itself in the technical education. It has gone
    a step ahead to attract potential students from the neighbouring States of Maharastra and Goa. Most of our alumni 
    and present students are from metros like Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and cities like Goa, Kolhapur, Hubli, Mangalore,
     Belgaum, Bagalkot, Bijapur etc. Having taken its birth in the lap of religious premises and having been blessed by 
     His Holiness Shri Shivalingeshwar Mahaswamiji of Duradundeeshwar Math, Nidasoshi, the Institute offers a spiritual
      feel and embrace to all its students and faculty. The forte of HIT is the delivery of unstinted and devoted technical
       education to our youths in a best possible manner by a team of qualified and experienced faculty and technical 
       supporting staff. Among many positive features, 100% result in many of the subjects and semesters is a regular 
       phenomenon in our Campus. Having spred over 48+ acres of land , our Campus offers a pollution-free and salubrious
        climate throughout the year. This makes the teaching-learning process an enduring experience to both students and 
        faculty . Our students, in addition to regular academics, have also excelled in extra curricular, cultural, and 
        sports activities. They have made many laudable achievements and have brought many laurels to the Institution.
         They, have proved that they are in-line with the students of many top-class institutions across the Country . 
         Our students are provided with addtional trainings in most-sought-after skill sets as per the needs of the 
         present day industries. Many of our students have been placed in many reputed organizations through our active 
         Training and Placement Cell. I, thus, feel very proud to invite the prospective students and their proud 
         parents/guardians to visit our Campus, have a feel of the ambience, and be a part of this Institution. With 
         regards and thanks</p>
